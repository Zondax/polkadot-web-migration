# Introduction

Launched on July 1, 2024, the new **Polkadot Universal Ledger App** delivers a major upgrade for users managing assets across the Polkadot ecosystem. By consolidating support for multiple Substrate-based chains into a single, secure application, it streamlines asset management across networks such as Kusama, AssetHub, Acala, Ajuna, Bifrost, HydraDX, and many others.

However, for many users, migrating from older Ledger-based apps remains a challenge. The hurdle isn't the app itself, it's the **lack of a guided, user-friendly interface** to assist with the migration.

That's where the **Polkadot Migration Assistant** comes in.

## What is the Migration Assistant?

The Polkadot Migration Assistant is a web-based tool designed to **streamline and simplify the migration process** for users transitioning to the new universal Ledger app.

The application allows users to connect their Ledger devices, automatically detect eligible accounts, indicate migration eligibility, and guide step-by-step through the migration process—offering transparency and reducing confusion.

## Why is it Important?

Older standalone Substrate-based Ledger apps (e.g., Kusama, AssetHub, Acala, Astar) are no longer maintained. Meanwhile, many parachains have undergone upgrades, causing some assets to become inaccessible or locked unless migrated.

These legacy apps often used different derivation paths, incompatible with the new Polkadot universal app. The Migration Assistant bridges this gap by helping users **move assets safely** from older apps to the new standard.

At launch, Polkadot, Kusama, and all system chains were fully supported, with parachain compatibility being rolled out progressively. To track which parachains are ready, you can follow the dashboard maintained by Parity Technologies.

## Is the Migration Assistant secure to use?

Yes. The security of all transactions remains on the Ledger device itself. The Migration Assistant only serves as a visual interface—it does not store or handle your private keys. Always **verify every transaction directly on your Ledger device** before confirming.
