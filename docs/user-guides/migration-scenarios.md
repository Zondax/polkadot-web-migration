## Scenario 1: Simple Balance Migration

### Overview
The most straightforward migration scenario involving accounts with only native token balances.

### Prerequisites
- Account with DOT/KSM balance
- No staking, identity, or multisig complications
- Sufficient balance for transaction fees

### Example: Polkadot Account Migration

**Account Details:**
```
Address: 1ChFweNRLzrZsT77vYzqhTHhgFhc5fy8sZ6UnMZU1xhyGGNF
Balance: 25.5 DOT
Reserved: 0 DOT
Frozen: 0 DOT
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**

#### 1. Account Discovery
```
‚úÖ Connect Ledger with Polkadot Legacy app
‚úÖ Migration Assistant detects account
‚úÖ Shows balance: 25.5 DOT available for migration
‚úÖ No special operations required
```

#### 2. Migration Planning
```
Migration Plan:
- Operation: Balance Transfer
- From: Legacy derivation path (m/44'/354'/0'/0'/0')
- To: Universal derivation path (m/44'/354'/0'/0'/0')
- Amount: 25.49 DOT (leaving 0.01 DOT for fees)
- Estimated Fee: ~0.01 DOT
```

#### 3. Transaction Execution
```
Transaction Details:
- Method: balances.transfer
- Destination: 1ChFweNRLzrZsT77vYzqhTHhgFhc5fy8sZ6UnMZU1xhyGGNF (Universal app address)
- Amount: 254,900,000,000 (25.49 DOT in Planck units)
- Fee: 153,000,000 (~0.0153 DOT)

Ledger Verification:
‚ñ° Verify destination address matches
‚ñ° Confirm amount: 25.49 DOT
‚ñ° Check fee: ~0.0153 DOT
‚ñ° Approve transaction
```

#### 4. Completion and Verification
```
Post-Migration State:
‚úÖ Transaction hash: 0x1234...abcd
‚úÖ Block inclusion: #12,345,678
‚úÖ Universal app shows balance: 25.49 DOT
‚úÖ Legacy app shows balance: ~0.005 DOT (remaining dust)

Verification Steps:
1. Check balance in Polkadot Universal app
2. Verify transaction on polkadot.subscan.io
3. Confirm account accessible in compatible wallets
```

**Expected Duration:** 2-3 minutes  
**Complexity:** ‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (Very Easy)

## Scenario 2: Staking Account Migration

### Overview
Migration of accounts with active staking positions, requiring unstaking and withdrawal operations.

### Prerequisites
- Account with bonded tokens
- Understanding of unbonding periods
- Patience for waiting periods (up to 28 days)

### Example: Kusama Validator Nomination Migration

**Account Details:**
```
Stash Address: HNZata7iMYWmk5RvZRTiAsSDhV8366zq2YGb3tLH5Upf74F
Controller Address: Fh8yx2RVqniznJvyb8xmFdnKVfrJVrq8zjNJnQGXvFHgcAv
Total Bonded: 150 KSM
Active Stake: 150 KSM
Nominations: 16 validators
Unbonding: None
Rewards: ~2.5 KSM pending
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**

#### 1. Account Analysis
```
Migration Assistant Discovery:
‚úÖ Detects stash account with active nominations
‚úÖ Identifies controller relationship
‚úÖ Shows bonded amount: 150 KSM
‚úÖ Lists 16 nominated validators
‚ö†Ô∏è Flags: Requires unstaking before migration
```

#### 2. Pre-Migration Planning
```
Required Operations:
1. Unbond all staked tokens (150 KSM)
2. Wait for unbonding period (7 days on Kusama)
3. Withdraw unbonded tokens
4. Transfer remaining balance to Universal app

Timeline:
- Day 0: Initiate unbonding
- Day 7+: Withdraw and migrate
- Total time: ~7 days minimum
```

#### 3. Phase 1: Initiate Unbonding

```
Transaction 1: Unbond Tokens
- Method: staking.unbond
- Amount: 150,000,000,000,000 (150 KSM in Planck units)
- Fee: ~0.01 KSM

Ledger Verification:
‚ñ° Confirm operation: "Unbond"
‚ñ° Verify amount: 150 KSM
‚ñ° Check you understand 7-day waiting period
‚ñ° Approve unbonding transaction

Result:
‚úÖ Tokens moved to "unbonding" state
‚úÖ Era 2847 marked as withdrawal era
‚è≥ 7-day countdown begins
```

#### 4. Phase 2: Waiting Period

```
During Unbonding Period:
- Tokens remain locked but earn no rewards
- Cannot be withdrawn until era 2847 + 28 eras
- Account remains visible in Universal app
- Monitor progress in Migration Assistant

Monitoring Tools:
- Check unbonding status: polkadot-js/apps
- Era progress: kusama.subscan.io
- Estimated completion: [specific date/time]
```

#### 5. Phase 3: Withdrawal and Migration

```
Transaction 2: Withdraw Unbonded
- Method: staking.withdrawUnbonded
- Slashing Spans: 0 (typical for most accounts)
- Fee: ~0.01 KSM

Post-Withdrawal State:
- Unbonded tokens now in "free" balance
- Available for transfer or other operations
- Account no longer shows as "staking"

Transaction 3: Balance Migration
- Method: balances.transfer
- Amount: 149.98 KSM (keeping some for fees)
- Destination: Universal app address
- Fee: ~0.01 KSM
```

#### 6. Completion and Re-staking

```
Post-Migration Actions:
1. Verify balance in Universal app: ~149.98 KSM
2. Re-stake using Universal app if desired
3. Update validator nominations if needed
4. Monitor new staking rewards

New Staking Setup (Optional):
- Use same validators or select new ones
- Consider updated validator performance
- Set up auto-compound if available
```

**Expected Duration:** 7+ days (due to unbonding period)  
**Complexity:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (Moderate - requires patience)

## Scenario 3: Identity Account Migration

### Overview
Migration of accounts with registered on-chain identities, requiring careful handling of identity data and deposits.

### Prerequisites
- Account with verified identity
- Understanding of deposit recovery
- Decision about identity preservation vs. removal

### Example: People Chain Identity Migration

**Account Details:**
```
Address: 14Gjs1TD93gnwEBfDMHoCgsuf1s2TVKUP6Z1qKmAP6p1o6e
Identity: "Alice Validator"
  - Display: Alice Validator
  - Legal: Alice Johnson
  - Web: https://alice-validator.com
  - Email: alice@alice-validator.com
  - Twitter: @alice_validator
Judgements: 
  - Registrar #0: Known Good
  - Registrar #1: Reasonable
Deposit: 20.258 DOT
Sub-identities: 2 (total deposit: 10.129 DOT)
```

**Migration Options:**

#### Option A: Preserve Identity (Recommended)
Identity automatically migrates with Universal app - no action needed.

#### Option B: Remove Identity and Recover Deposits

**Step-by-Step Process:**

#### 1. Identity Analysis
```
Migration Assistant Discovery:
‚úÖ Detects on-chain identity
‚úÖ Shows identity details and judgements
‚úÖ Calculates total deposits: 30.387 DOT
‚ö†Ô∏è Warns about identity removal consequences
‚ö†Ô∏è Checks for sub-identity dependencies
```

#### 2. Pre-Removal Considerations
```
Important Decisions:
‚ñ° Do you want to preserve reputation and judgements?
‚ñ° Are sub-identities still needed?
‚ñ° Do services depend on your verified identity?
‚ñ° Is deposit recovery worth losing verification?

Dependencies Check:
- Validator identity for commission/trust
- DeFi protocol whitelisting
- NFT marketplace verification
- DAO membership recognition
```

#### 3. Sub-Identity Management

```
Sub-Identity 1: 13UVJyLnbVp9RBZYFwFGyDvVd1y27Tt8tkntv6Q7JVPhFsTB
- Name: "Alice Stash"
- Deposit: 5.0645 DOT

Sub-Identity 2: 15oF4uVJwmo4TdGW7VfQxNLavjCXviqxT9S1MgbjMNHr6Sp5
- Name: "Alice Pool"  
- Deposit: 5.0645 DOT

Required Actions:
1. Clear sub-identity 1: clearIdentity transaction
2. Clear sub-identity 2: clearIdentity transaction  
3. Remove main identity: clearIdentity transaction
```

#### 4. Identity Removal Process

```
Transaction 1: Clear Sub-Identity 1
- Method: identity.clearIdentity

- Account: 14Gjs1TD93gnwEBfDMHoCgsuf1s2TVKUP6Z1qKmAP6p1o6e
- Deposit Recovery: 20.258 DOT

Total Deposit Recovery: 30.387 DOT
```

#### 5. Migration Completion

```
Post-Identity-Removal State:
‚úÖ All identity data cleared from chain
‚úÖ Deposits recovered: 30.387 DOT
‚úÖ Account balance increased
‚ùå Verification status lost
‚ùå Judgements no longer valid

Final Migration:
- Method: balances.transfer
- Amount: [original balance + 30.387 DOT - fees]
- Destination: Universal app address

Post-Migration:
‚ñ° Re-register identity in Universal app if desired
‚ñ° Request new judgements from registrars
‚ñ° Update service configurations

## üîß Migration Tools and Utilities

### Batch Operation Tools

```javascript
// Example: Batch NFT Transfer
const batchNFTTransfer = {
  method: 'utility.batch',
  calls: [
    api.tx.nfts.transfer(collection1, item1, destination),
    api.tx.nfts.transfer(collection1, item2, destination),
    api.tx.nfts.transfer(collection2, item3, destination)
  ]
};

// Estimate total fees
const totalFee = await api.tx.utility.batch(calls).paymentInfo(signer);
```

### Migration Progress Tracking

```typescript
interface MigrationProgress {
  totalOperations: number;
  completedOperations: number;
  failedOperations: string[];
  estimatedCompletion: Date;
  currentPhase: MigrationPhase;
}

// Track progress through complex migration
const progress = useMigrationProgress();
progress.updatePhase('staking-operations');
progress.markOperationComplete('unbond-tokens');
```

### Fee Estimation Calculator

```typescript
// Calculate total migration costs
function estimateTotalFees(operations: MigrationOperation[]): FeeEstimate {
  let totalFee = BigNumber(0);
  
  for (const op of operations) {
    switch (op.type) {
      case 'transfer':
        totalFee = totalFee.plus(TRANSFER_FEE);
        break;
      case 'unstake':
        totalFee = totalFee.plus(STAKING_FEE);
        break;
      case 'multisig':
        totalFee = totalFee.plus(MULTISIG_FEE.times(op.threshold));
        break;
    }
  }
  
  return {
    total: totalFee.toString(),
    breakdown: operations.map(op => ({
      operation: op.type,
      fee: getFeeForOperation(op)
    }))
  };
}
```
