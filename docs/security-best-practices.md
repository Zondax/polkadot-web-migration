# Security & Best Practices

This comprehensive guide covers security considerations, best practices, and recommendations for safely using the Polkadot Migration Assistant.

## üîê Core Security Principles

### Hardware Wallet Security Model

The Migration Assistant is built on the foundation of **hardware wallet security**, where your private keys never leave the Ledger device:

```
üîí Private Keys ‚Üí Always remain on Ledger device
üîí Seed Phrase ‚Üí Never entered into Migration Assistant
üîí Transaction Signing ‚Üí Performed exclusively on Ledger
üîí User Verification ‚Üí Required for every operation
```

### Zero-Trust Architecture

The Migration Assistant operates on a **zero-trust model**:
- No sensitive data is stored in browsers or servers
- Every transaction requires explicit user approval
- All operations are verified on-device
- No automatic transactions or background operations

## üõ°Ô∏è Pre-Migration Security Checklist

### Device Security

**‚úÖ Ledger Device Verification**
```
Before starting migration:
‚ñ° Verify Ledger device is genuine (check authenticity at setup)
‚ñ° Ensure firmware is updated to latest version
‚ñ° Confirm device hasn't been tampered with
‚ñ° Test device functionality with small transactions first
```

**‚úÖ Computer Security**
```
System Requirements:
‚ñ° Use trusted computer with updated OS
‚ñ° Run antivirus scan before migration
‚ñ° Ensure no keyloggers or malware present
‚ñ° Close unnecessary applications during migration
‚ñ° Use private/incognito browsing mode
```

**‚úÖ Network Security**
```
Connection Safety:
‚ñ° Use secure, private internet connection
‚ñ° Avoid public WiFi for migration operations
‚ñ° Verify HTTPS connection (lock icon in browser)
‚ñ° Check SSL certificate validity
‚ñ° Consider using VPN for additional privacy
```

### Browser Security Setup

**‚úÖ Browser Preparation**
```
Recommended Configuration:
‚ñ° Use latest version of supported browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
‚ñ° Enable automatic security updates
‚ñ° Disable unnecessary browser extensions
‚ñ° Clear cache and browsing data before starting
‚ñ° Enable strict site isolation if available
```

**‚úÖ Permission Management**
```
WebUSB Permissions:
‚ñ° Only grant USB permissions to official Migration Assistant
‚ñ° Review and revoke permissions for untrusted sites
‚ñ° Use site-specific permissions, not global access
‚ñ° Monitor permission requests carefully
```

## üîç Transaction Verification Process

### Critical Verification Steps

Every transaction must be verified through this **mandatory process**:

#### 1. Pre-Transaction Review
```
Before signing on Ledger:
‚ñ° Review operation type and parameters in Migration Assistant
‚ñ° Verify destination addresses match expectations
‚ñ° Confirm transaction amounts are correct
‚ñ° Check estimated fees are reasonable
‚ñ° Understand what the transaction will accomplish
```

#### 2. Ledger Device Verification
```
On Ledger screen, verify:
‚ñ° Transaction type matches intended operation
‚ñ° Destination address is exactly as expected
‚ñ° Amount (if applicable) matches your intention
‚ñ° Fee amount is acceptable
‚ñ° All transaction parameters are correct

‚ùå NEVER approve if ANY detail looks wrong or unfamiliar
```

#### 3. Post-Transaction Monitoring
```
After signing:
‚ñ° Monitor transaction status in Migration Assistant
‚ñ° Verify transaction hash on block explorer
‚ñ° Confirm transaction inclusion in block
‚ñ° Check that account balances updated correctly
‚ñ° Save transaction hash for records
```

### Red Flags - When to STOP

**üö® Immediately stop and investigate if:**
- Destination addresses don't match what you expect
- Transaction amounts seem wrong or excessive
- Unfamiliar transaction types appear
- Multiple unexpected transactions are queued
- Migration Assistant behavior seems abnormal
- Ledger displays different details than Migration Assistant
- You receive any social engineering attempts

## üéØ Operation-Specific Security

### Staking Operations

**Security Considerations:**
```
Unstaking Tokens:
‚ñ° Understand unbonding periods before starting
‚ñ° Verify you have sufficient balance for fees
‚ñ° Confirm you're unstaking from correct validator
‚ñ° Plan for token lockup period

Withdrawal Operations:
‚ñ° Ensure unbonding period has completed
‚ñ° Verify withdrawal destination is your account
‚ñ° Check that withdrawal amount matches expectations
‚ñ° Monitor for any remaining bonded amounts
```

**Common Security Mistakes:**
- Unstaking during slash events (may lose rewards)
- Not accounting for network fees in withdrawal
- Withdrawing to wrong account addresses
- Missing partial unbonding chunks

### Identity Management

**Security Best Practices:**
```
Identity Removal:
‚ñ° Understand deposit implications
‚ñ° Verify identity removal is actually desired
‚ñ° Check for dependent sub-identities
‚ñ° Confirm parent/child relationship status
‚ñ° Save identity information before removal
```

**Security Warnings:**
- Identity removal is irreversible
- Sub-identities may be affected
- Reputation and judgements will be lost
- Some services may stop recognizing your account

### Multisig Operations

**Enhanced Security Model:**
```
Multisig Coordination:
‚ñ° Verify all participants are legitimate
‚ñ° Use secure communication channels
‚ñ° Double-check transaction details with co-signers
‚ñ° Confirm threshold requirements
‚ñ° Monitor all approval stages
```

**Advanced Security:**
- Never share coordination details publicly
- Use time-bounded operations when possible
- Implement approval timeouts for security
- Monitor for unauthorized approval attempts
- Keep detailed records of all multisig operations
