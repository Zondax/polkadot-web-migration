## Account Discovery

By default, the application synchronizes the first 10 accounts of each app when connecting to a Ledger device. This behavior can be customized by setting the 'NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_ADDRESSES_TO_FETCH' environment variable to your desired number of accounts.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- pnpm (for package management)
- A Polkadot-compatible Ledger device (optional)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd polkadot-web-migration
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Initialize your dev environment:

```bash
pnpm env:init
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
# For development with limited transfer amount (100 units)
pnpm dev

# For development with full transfer amount
pnpm dev:full-amount
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Starts the development server with limited native transfer amounts (100 units), useful for testing with controlled amounts
- `pnpm dev:full-amount` - Starts the development server without transfer amount limitations, allowing full balance transfers
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm build:docker` - Build Docker image for the application
- `pnpm start:docker` - Start the Docker container for the application
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm test` - Run tests with coverage
- `pnpm test:coverage` - Run tests with detailed coverage report
- `pnpm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `pnpm test:e2e` - Run E2E tests with Playwright
- `pnpm test:e2e:debug` - Run E2E tests in debug mode
- `pnpm test:e2e:ui` - Run E2E tests with UI
- `pnpm test:e2e:install` - Install Playwright browsers
- `pnpm test:e2e:report` - Show Playwright test report
- `pnpm test:e2e:sharding` - Run E2E tests with sharding configuration
- `pnpm lint` - Run Biome linter
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Fix issues with Biome
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Biome and sort package.json
- `pnpm format:check` - Check code formatting
- `pnpm deps:update` - Update dependencies
- `pnpm env:init` - Initialize environment variables

### Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js app router pages and layouts
- `components/` - Reusable React components
- `config/` - Application configuration
- `lib/` - Utility functions and shared libraries
- `public/` - Static assets
- `state/` - State management logic with legendapp/state

### Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles:

- Business logic is separated from state management
- Services are agnostic of state management libraries
- Core business logic and interfaces are in separate files
- UI components are modular and composable

## Adding New Chains

This project provides a flexible configuration system for adding custom blockchain networks:

1. Add your chain logo to the `public/logos/chains` directory (the image filename must match the chain `id` you'll use in the configuration)
2. Add chain configuration in the `config/appsConfig.json` file with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "your-chain-id",
     "name": "Your Chain Name",
     "cla": 123,
     "bip44Path": "m/44'/123'/0'/0'/0'",
     "ss58Prefix": 42,
     "rpcEndpoint": "wss://rpc.yourchain.network",
     "peopleRpcEndpoint": "wss://people-rpc.yourchain.network",
     "token": {
       "symbol": "SYMBOL",
       "decimals": 12,
       "logoId": "token-icon-id"
     }
   }
   ```

Each chain configuration contains these key parameters:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the chain (must match the logo filename in the chains directory)
- `name`: Display name of the chain
- `cla`: Chain-specific class identifier
- `bip44Path`: The HD derivation path for the chain
- `ss58Prefix`: The SS58 address format prefix
- `rpcEndpoint`: WebSocket endpoint for connecting to the chain
- `peopleRpcEndpoint`: (Optional) WebSocket endpoint for the people chain, if applicable
- `token`: An object containing token information:
  - `symbol`: The currency symbol
  - `decimals`: Number of decimal places for the currency
  - `logoId`: (Optional) Used when the token's icon is different from the chain's icon (e.g., Asset Hubs)

For detailed examples of how to structure your chain configuration, refer to the existing entries in the appsConfig.json file.

## Using Docker Scripts

You can use the provided npm scripts to simplify building and running the Docker container:

### Build the Docker image

```sh
pnpm build:docker
```

This runs `docker build -t polkadot-migration .` to create the Docker image.

### Run the Docker container

```sh
pnpm start:docker
```

By default, this will map port 3000 from the container to port 3000 on your local machine. The script uses the `PORT` environment variable, so you can specify a custom port if needed:

```sh
PORT=4000 pnpm start:docker
```

This will map port 4000 on your machine to port 3000 in the container. Then access the app at <http://localhost:4000>
