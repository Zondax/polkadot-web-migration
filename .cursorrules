# Project Rules and Guidelines

## Lessons

- When refactoring code with observable state, separate business logic from state management by creating dedicated service classes that are agnostic of state management libraries
- Use clean architecture principles to improve code scalability, reusability, and maintainability
- Keep state management in a thin layer that delegates to core business logic services
- Export service instances as singletons to ensure consistent state across the application
- Place interfaces and core business logic in separate files to maintain a clean separation of concerns
